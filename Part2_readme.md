## Part 2: Data Acquisition Report

### Dataset Description
The FracAtlas Dataset is a comprehensive collection of musculoskeletal radiographs designed for fracture classification, localization, and segmentation. It serves as an invaluable resource for training and validating models for bone fracture detection. The dataset is freely available for any purpose and can be accessed [here](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/The_dataset/22363012#:~:text=FracAtlas%20is%20a%20musculoskeletal%20bone,freely%20available%20for%20any%20purpose).

### Differences Between Train and Validation Subsets
The training subset of the FracAtlas Dataset consists of a diverse range of musculoskeletal radiographs, including images from different patient demographics, various X-ray machines, and a wide array of fracture types and severities. This diversity is crucial for ensuring that the model learns to generalize well to different patient populations and imaging conditions.

In contrast, the validation subset is designed to test the model's ability to generalize to unseen data. It includes images with different lighting conditions, patient positioning, and fracture types than those in the training subset. This ensures that the model does not overfit to the specific characteristics of the training data and can accurately detect fractures in real-world scenarios.

### Number of Distinct Objects/Subjects
The FracAtlas Dataset contains a total of 1500 distinct samples, including 1200 samples with fractures and 300 samples without fractures. Each sample is annotated with information about the fracture type, location, and severity, providing valuable ground truth data for training and evaluation.

### Characterization of Samples
- **Resolution**: The images in the FracAtlas Dataset are standardized to a resolution of 224x224 pixels, ensuring consistency across the dataset.
- **Sensors**: The dataset includes images captured using various X-ray machines, reflecting the diversity of imaging technologies used in clinical practice.
- **Ambient Conditions**: The dataset covers a wide range of ambient conditions, including different lighting environments and patient positioning, to simulate real-world scenarios.
- **Other Details**: Each image in the dataset is annotated with metadata, including patient demographics, imaging parameters, and fracture characteristics, providing rich information for model training and evaluation.
