# Fracture Classification Using CNN and FracAtlas Dataset

## Overview
This README documents the development and validation of a neural network-based model designed for detecting fractures in X-ray images. The model utilizes the comprehensive FracAtlas Dataset, which includes 4,083 musculoskeletal radiographs designed to encompass a broad spectrum of imaging conditions.

## Dataset Description

### Training Subset
- **Total Images**: 483 X-ray images.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Diverse range of musculoskeletal radiographs from different patient demographics.
  - Various types of X-ray machines used.
  - Wide array of fracture types and severities.
- **Purpose**: To ensure the model learns to generalize across different patient populations and imaging conditions.

### Validation Subset
- **Characteristics**:
  - Includes images with different lighting conditions, patient positioning, and fracture types compared to the training set.
- **Purpose**: To test the model's ability to generalize to unseen data and to prevent overfitting to the training set characteristics.

### Why you believe these differences are sufficient to test the generalization capabilities of your final NN-based models?
- **Diverse Patient Demographics**:
  - Differences in age, body size, and underlying health conditions can affect the appearance of bones and fractures in X-rays. A model trained with a wide demographic range is more likely to perform well across the general population.
- **Variety of X-ray Machines**:
  - Different X-ray machines can produce images with varying resolutions, contrasts, and noise levels. Training and validating with images from multiple machines ensures that the model can handle variations stemming from the imaging equipment used in different clinical settings.
- **Range of Fracture Types and Severities**:
  - Fractures can vary widely in their appearanceâ€” from clear, linear breaks to subtle, hairline fractures. A model that has seen a broad range of fracture types during training and is tested against even broader or different types in validation is better at identifying various fracture cases.
- **Different Lighting Conditions and Patient Positioning**:
  - These factors can significantly alter how a fracture appears in an X-ray. Models tested against variations in lighting and positioning are less likely to fail in practical scenarios where ideal imaging conditions can't always be guaranteed.

## Model Design

### Generalization Capabilities
Testing the generalization capabilities of neural networks, especially in medical imaging for fracture detection, relies on a well-designed validation subset:
1. **Diverse Patient Demographics**: Accounts for variations in bone appearance due to age, body size, and health conditions.
2. **Variety of X-ray Machines**: Ensures the model can handle different image resolutions, contrasts, and noise levels.
3. **Range of Fracture Types and Severities**: From clear, linear breaks to subtle, hairline fractures.
4. **Different Lighting Conditions and Patient Positioning**: Adapts to how fractures appear under varying imaging conditions.
5. **Unseen Data in Validation**: Assesses true learning and generalization beyond the training data memorization.

### Enhancements to Improve Model Robustness

#### Data Augmentation Techniques
- **Techniques Used**: Rotation, flipping, scaling, and brightness adjustments.
- **Purpose**:
  - Increases model robustness to variations in clinical imaging.
  - Simulates different clinical environments.
- **Specific Techniques**:
  - **Brightness and Contrast Adjustment**: Helps the model process images with varying exposure levels, addressing common issues in radiographic diagnostics.
  - **Scaling**: Trains the model on images at different scales to better detect fractures regardless of the X-ray zoom level.

#### Advanced Regularization Techniques
- **Techniques Used**: Dropout and Spatial Dropout.
- **Purpose**: Minimizes overfitting by reducing dependence on specific training data features, thus enhancing generalization to new data.
- **Application**: Particularly useful in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for tasks like bone fracture detection in X-ray images.
